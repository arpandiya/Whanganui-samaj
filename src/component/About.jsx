<li className="text-bolder underline my-2">Social Events:</li>  We host regular events to celebrate Nepali cultures and traditions, providing a taste of home for our members and a chance for the wider community to experience our culture.

<li className="text-bolder underline my-2">Community Support:</li> We offer guidance and assistance to new immigrants, helping them with settlement challenges, language support, and navigating local services.

Our society is more than just an organization; it's a family that stands ready to support its members and contribute to the rich cultural tapestry of Whanganui.
